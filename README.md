        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

## Description

*Also known as a Bubble Series, Bubble Chart and Bubble Graph*

This type of series are often used to present financial or statistical data because they the easiest and well-understood visual comparisons of measures.

The series typically accepts points in format `{ x: number, y: number, size: number }`.
